A line of therapy is defined as one or more cycles of a planned treatment program. This may consist of one or more planned cycles of single-agent therapy\nor combination therapy, as well as a sequence of treatments administered in a planned manner (ie induction chemotherapy/chemotherapies when followed by stem cell transplantation is considered to be 1 line of therapy). A new\nline of therapy starts when a planned course of therapy is modified to include other treatment agents (alone or in combination) as a result of disease progression, relapse or toxicity, the exception to this being the need to attain a\nsufficient response for stem cell transplantation to proceed. A new line of therapy also starts when a planned period of observation off therapy is interrupted by a need for additional treatment for the disease.\nPatients who commenced on the Interim COVID option of ixazomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Blueteq form code IXA2CV) as a second line therapy instead of daratumumab bortezomib and dexamethasone during the\nCOVID19 pandemic to avoid hospital admissions can be granted an exception to the 1 prior line of therapy rule.\nPlease tick box below:\n- this patient has received 1 and no more than 1 prior line of treatment or\n- this patient has received 2 lines of treatment the 2nd of which was the temporary COVID-related option of 2nd line ixazomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Blueteq form code IXA2CV)\nNote: The use of daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in the 1-prior treatment setting was the place in the treatment pathway chosen by Janssen for its submission to NICE for the appraisal of clinical\nand cost effectiveness of this daratumumab combination and thus is the basis of NICE\u2019s recommendation.",

Please mark which of these 4 clinical scenarios applies to this patient:\n- the patient was treated with docetaxel and completed a planned treatment duration of 6 cycles of docetaxel\n- the patient commenced docetaxel and discontinued docetaxel prior to completion of 6 cycles on account of excessive toxicity (i.e. the patient COULD NOT complete planned treatment duration with docetaxel)\n- the patient had significant comorbidities which precluded treatment with docetaxel (i.e. the patient SHOULD NOT be treated with docetaxel) and this has been fully discussed with the patient. It is recommended that validated systems of\nscoring clinical frailty are used as part of the oncology assessment as to explaining the benefits and risks of the treatment options of chemotherapy and enzalutamide\n- the patient is fit for chemotherapy with docetaxel and has chosen not to be treated with docetaxel. The patient has been fully consented regarding all of the following: the advantages and disadvantages of upfront docetaxel chemotherapy vs\nupfront enzalutamide; that the use of upfront enzalutamide would result in there being no further possible treatment with any androgen receptor targeted agents when the patient\u2019s disease progresses; and that the patient may not be fit\nenough to receive docetaxel when the patient\u2018s disease progresses.
